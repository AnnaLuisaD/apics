    <body><p class="c10">According to Hajek’s
(2005) world-wide survey, contrastive nasal vowels are found only
in about a quarter of the world’s languages, with a heavy areal
concentration in equatorial South America and West Africa. Among
the <i>APiCS</i> languages, 34 are reported to have some nasal
vowels:</p><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" width="367">

</tbody></table><p class="c10">Thus, it is not
surprising that almost all of the languages with nasal vowels in
<i>APiCS</i> are spoken in the Atlantic region. There seems to be a
clear substrate effect here, with nasalization of vowels in African
languages influencing the creoles (Boretzky 1983: 53-56, Parkvall
2000: 30-31). <i>APiCS</i> has nasal vowels also in South Asia and
in the Indian Ocean, which again fits with Hajek’s observations, as
he finds a local concentration of languages with vowel nasalization
in South Asia.</p><p class="c10">But the lexifier
languages, too, have a strong influence on the distribution of
nasal vowels. French and Portuguese have nasal vowel phonemes, so
nasal vowels are particularly prominent in languages with these
lexical bases.</p><p class="c10">Nasal vowels are said
to be <b>present in a prominent way</b> if there are nasal vowels
as major allophones in at least three different heights (e.g. ĩ,
<span class="c22">ɛ̃</span>, ã; see
Chapter 121 on vowel height). Of the 14 languages in this category,
eight are based on Portuguese, which has three heights of nasal
vowels. Four are English-based languages, where the nasal vowels
are clearly secondary, deriving from sequences of vowel +
syllable-final nasal, for example:</p><p class="c10"><a href="/contributions/16">Ghanaian Pidgin English</a> <a href="/contributions/8">Jamaican</a></p><p class="c10"><span class="c23">bĩ</span> <span class="c22">‘bean’</span> <span class="c23">suhn</span> <span class="c22">[sũ]</span> <span class="c22">‘soon’</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c23">tɛ̃</span> <span class="c22">‘ten’</span> <span class="c23">sohn</span> <span class="c22">[sɔ̃]</span> <span class="c22">‘some’</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c23">kã</span> <span class="c22">‘come’</span> <span class="c23">pahn</span> <span class="c22">[pã]</span> <span class="c22">‘(up)on’</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c22">Nasal vowels are</span> <span class="c24">present in a limited way</span>
<span class="c22">if there are some
nasal vowels as major allophones, but at most in two vowel heights.
This is the pattern of French (which only has [ã], [ɛ̃], [ɔ̃]), and
almost all French-based creoles are represented in this value.
(<a href="/contributions/57">Tayo</a> in New Caledonia is the only French-based creole that lacks
nasal vowels, evidently because the Austronesian substrates lack
them.)</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c22">Another 11 languages have nasal
vowels</span> <span class="c24">only
as minor allophones</span><span class="c22">. Since vowels are always to some extent phonetically
nasalized in front of nasal consonants, more languages could
probably be categorized in this way.</span></p>
