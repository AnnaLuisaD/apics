<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3distribution" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="western c12"><span class="c31">Numerical</span><span class="c16">.</span> <span class="c15">Although noun-adjective is the prevalent order among the
world’s languages (768 of 1005 languages in Dryer 2011a), a
preceding adjective is clearly the dominant pattern among the
(admittedly skewed sample of) languages represented in</span>
<span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">(69/76), with 34
varieties using this pattern exclusively and another 35 having
preceding adjectives along with following adjectives. The
noun-adjective pattern is found in 42</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">languages, of which only 7 are
exclusively noun-adjective. These are <a href="/contributions/68">Ambon Malay</a>, <a href="/contributions/64">Juba Arabic</a>,
<a href="/contributions/58">Kikongo-Kituba</a>, <a href="/contributions/63">Kinubi</a>, <a href="/contributions/60">Lingala</a>, <a href="/contributions/62">Mixed Ma’a/Mbugu</a> and <a href="/contributions/42">Papiá Kristang</a>.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c31">Geographic/areal</span><span class="c15">. While
Dryer’s</span> <span class="c16">WALS</span> <span class="c15">map
shows rather well-defined areas of noun-adjective and
adjective-noun languages, the two patterns appear to be more or
less evenly spread around the world as far as</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">languages are concerned. This
may well be due to the fact that the contact languages documented
in</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">often
involved large-scale migrations and that the concept of areality in
the traditional sense is therefore problematic in this
case.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c31">By lexifier/substrate</span><span class="c15">. For
most</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">languages, Feature 3 appears to be a rather clear case of
lexifier influence: with only two exceptions (<a href="/contributions/73">Media Lengua</a>, <a href="/contributions/42">Papiá Kristang</a>) the 27 Romance language-lexified contact languages allow
both the adjective-noun and the noun-adjective pattern, just as in
French, Portuguese or Spanish. A number of</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">contributors note that
similarities with the lexifier even extend to which adjectives may
precede or follow nouns or to the meaning difference of the same
adjective in pre- or postnominal position. Of the two exceptions
mentioned above, the mixed language <a href="/contributions/73">Media Lengua</a> is exclusively
adjective-noun, closely following the Quechua model, while <a href="/contributions/42">Papiá Kristang</a>’s exclusive noun-adjective order seems to have been the
result of a strong sub- or adstratal influence of Malay. As to the
Germanic lexifier languages, 25 out of 28 varieties in our sample
have only preceding adjectives, just as in English and Dutch. Among
the non-European lexified contact languages, we find the same trend
of copying the lexifier order. For example, <a href="/contributions/58">Kikongo-Kituba</a>, <a href="/contributions/60">Lingala</a>
and <a href="/contributions/62">Mixed Ma’a/Mbugu</a> (Bantu), <a href="/contributions/64">Juba Arabic</a> and <a href="/contributions/63">Kinubi</a> (Arabic) and
<a href="/contributions/68">Ambon Malay</a> (Malay) copy the noun-adjective order of their
lexifiers.</span></p><p class="western c36">In some cases
the lexifier and substrates have the same order of the adjective
relative to the noun – as in <a href="/contributions/64">Juba Arabic</a> and <a href="/contributions/63">Kinubi</a>, whose Sudanese
substrates are also noun-adjective – but the Central African <a href="/contributions/59">Sango</a>
copies the adjective-noun model of its lexifier Ngbandi in spite of
the fact that the pidginizers spoke either languages that were
predominantly noun-adjective (speakers from East and West Africa
and from the equatorial regions of the Congo River) or had both
patterns (French-speaking Europeans; see Samarin 2013a). <a href="/contributions/61">Fanakalo</a>’s
adjective-noun is a surprising exception, its main lexifiers Zulu
and Xhosa as well as the Bantu substrates being noun-adjective
languages. Here, the adjective-noun sequence is possibly modelled
on the structure of the socially dominant English and
<a href="/contributions/29">Afrikaans</a>-speaking pidginizers of Zulu and Xhosa.</p><p class="western c37"><span class="c15">The fact that <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a>, <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a>, and <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a> (all spoken in
the Australia-Pacific region) have both orders may also be due to
substratal influence. <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a> in northern Australia is spoken in a
region with a mix of languages allowing pre-, post and both pre-
and postmodifying adjectives. <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a> and <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a> are spoken in
areas where the overwhelming majority of languages are
premodifying, but there is historical evidence that both languages
received a strong input from a pidgin spoken on plantations in
Queensland, (eastern Australia), an area where both orders are
found. In addition, <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a> was influenced by Tolai, one of the
few languages in Papua New Guinea that has no dominant order
according to</span> <span class="c16">WALS</span><span class="c15">.</span></p><p class="western c37"><span class="c15">The rule for <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a> and <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a> is that</span>
<span class="c13">adjectives modified by</span> <span class="c14">-fala</span><span class="c13">/</span><span class="c14">-pela</span> <span class="c13">precede the noun while the

the mixed language <a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a> (French nouns, Cree verbs) is
interesting: <a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a> adjectives are of French origin and as in
French, they either precede or follow the noun (Cree does not have
adjectives but expresses noun modification through relative clauses
or by noun-prefixation (Bakker 1997: 106). Compare example (5)
above).</p><p class="western c37"><span class="c15">The three Malay-lexified varieties in</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">show a wide variation with
only <a href="/contributions/68">Ambon Malay</a> following the Malay lexifier noun-adjective order.
<a href="/contributions/68">Ambon Malay</a> is spoken in an area of noun-adjective languages, just
like <a href="/contributions/67">Singapore Bazaar Malay</a>, which however shows both orders. This
is probably due to the fact that Indian and Chinese languages
(predominantly adjective-noun) were involved in the genesis of
Bazaar Malay (cf. Khin Khin Aye</span> <span class="c15">2013a).
Sri Lanka Malay seems to have adopted</span> <span class="c15">Tamil’s adjective-noun order (for the close contact between
Malays and Sri Lanka Muslim Tamils (see Slomanson</span>
<span class="c15">2013a).</span></p>
