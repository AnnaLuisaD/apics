For the languages with a European base (41 languages), these results are somewhat puzzling, especially for those languages which only have the zero pattern. Apparently the model of the base languages has not been taken over: In European languages, orientation towards a goal is always marked by a preposition, e.g. English I go to Paris, French Je vais \u00e0 Paris \u2018I go to Paris\u2019, Spanish/Portuguese Voy/Vou \u00e0/para Paris (expressions like I go home being quite exceptional). One could argue that in APiCS languages with value 1, the lack of the preposition is due to the simplification forces of the pidginization/ creolization process. In fact, many pidgins in APiCS show value 1. But this leaves us with the question why for instance Saramaccan, known as a radical creole, does show overt prepositional marking (value 2), a pattern which is also very wide-spread in APiCS (46 languages).",
