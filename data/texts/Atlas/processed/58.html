<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1alignmentinmonotransitiveconstructions" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="western c14"><span class="c11">Like the preceding chapter, this chapter considers
role-marking patterns (case-marking and adpositional marking) in
monotransitive clauses, i.e. clauses with a typical physical-effect
verb such as ‘break’ or ‘kill’. In accordance with widespread
typological practice (cf. <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="comrie2005">Comrie 2005</a>, <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="haspelmath2011">Haspelmath 2011</a>a), we
compare the coding of the monotransitive agent (A) and patient (P)
with the coding of the sole argument of a single-argument
intransitive clause (S). This kind of comparison is usually
called</span> <span class="c12">alignment</span> <span class="c11">(it can be carried out in a similar way with ditransitive
clauses, see Chapter 60). In</span> <span class="c13">APiCS</span>
<span class="c11">we limit ourselves to alignment of cases and
adpositions, and in this chapter we only consider full noun phrase
arguments (for personal pronouns, which often behave differently,
see Chapter 59).</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c11">When comparing the coding of the agent and patient with the
intransitive sole argument, there are five logical alignment
possibilities, of which only three are relevant in practice: the
pattern with identical coding of sole argument and agent, and
special coding of the patient (called</span> <span class="c12">accusative alignment</span><span class="c11">),</span>
<span class="c11">the pattern with identical coding of sole
argument and patient, and special coding of the agent
(called</span> <span class="c12">ergative
alignment</span><span class="c11">), and the pattern in which the
agent and the patient are coded identically and in the same way as
the sole argument (called</span> <span class="c12">neutral</span>
<span class="c11">alignment, always with zero coding).</span></p><p class="western c15">Figure 1. The
three main monotransitive alignment patterns</p><p class="western c15">The three
patterns are illustrated in (1-3), from English, Quechua (a South
American language) and Garrwa (an Australian language). The
corresponding intransitive clause, not given here for lack of
space, has an S argument with zero coding.</p><p class="western c15">(1) English:

<a href="#top" style="vertical-align: bottom" title="go to top of the page">⇫</a>
<a class="headerlink" href="#section-2thefeaturevalues" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c15">The three main
alignment types are the three feature values shown on the map. Only
the first two are at all common in our languages. (The other two
logical patterns, with different coding of A, S and P (tripartite
pattern), or with identical coding of A and P contrasting with the
coding of S (horizontal pattern), are not attested at all in
<i>APiCS</i>.)</p><p class="western c18">1. Neutral
alignment 61</p><p class="western c18">2. Accusative
alignment 14</p><p class="western c18">3. Ergative
alignment 1</p><p class="c15">The map is quite
similar to the map for patient marking (Chapter 57), as neutral
alignment is identical to absence of patient marking in practice,
while accusative alignment is identical to the possibility of
patient marking (whether patient marking is variable and optional,
as it is in most cases, or obligatory).</p><p class="c15">The only difference
between Chapter 57 and this chapter is the presence of an ergative
pattern in the mixed language <a href="/contributions/72">Gurindji <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a></a>, which has inherited
its ergative case from the Australian Aboriginal language Gurindji,
e.g.</p><p class="c15">(4)<span class="c20"><a href="/contributions/72">Gurindji <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a></a></span> <span class="c20">(Meakins 2013)</span></p><p class="c16">Karu-ngku im pangkily im marluka-Ø.</p><p class="c15"><span class="c20">child-ERG 3SG hit.on.head 3SG

most</span> <span class="c21">APiCS</span> <span class="c20">languages with an accusative pattern, ergative marking is
variable in <a href="/contributions/72">Gurindji <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a></a> (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="meakins2011">Meakins 2011</a>: 209-239).</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c20">The small map, adapted from</span>

shows the distribution of the three types in the world’s languages.
Tripartite and active-stative alignments, which do not occur
in</span> <span class="c21">APiCS</span><span class="c20">, have been omitted from this map. We see that ergative
alignment is found widely in Australia, and accusative alignment is
found in South Asia, which explains some of the patterns in</span>
