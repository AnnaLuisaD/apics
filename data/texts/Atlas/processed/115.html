<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1featuredescription" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="western c14"><span class="c13">Map 115 shows the identity or differentiation of the words
expressing the meanings ‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’, the latter used
transitively.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">In many languages of the world, one or several sense
perceptions and/or processes of cognition are expressed by the same
verb (cf. Evans &amp; Wilkins 2000, <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="vanhove2008">Vanhove 2008</a>). Compare e.g.
French</span> <span class="c16">entendre</span><span class="c15">,
which means both ‘to hear’ and ‘to understand’, or</span>
<span class="c16">sentir</span><span class="c15">, which can mean
‘to feel’, ‘to smell’, ‘to taste’ or more generally ‘to perceive’.
Such formal identity in the semantic domains of sense perception
and cognition is also common among the</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">languages. For example,
<a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a></span> <span class="c16">harem</span> <span class="c15">and
<a href="/contributions/63">Kinubi</a></span> <span class="c16">ásma</span> <span class="c15">both
mean ‘to hear’ and ‘to feel’, while <a href="/contributions/57">Tayo</a></span> <span class="c16">sa:(ti)</span> <span class="c15">and younger generation
<a href="/contributions/37">Principense</a></span> <span class="c16">xintxi</span> <span class="c15">mean ‘to smell’ and ‘to feel’. A very common case of identity
is that between ‘to hear’ and its metaphorical extension ‘to
understand’, as found, among others, in <a href="/contributions/76">Eskimo Pidgin</a></span>
<span class="c16">tusar-</span><span class="c15">, <a href="/contributions/16">Ghanaian Pidgin English</a></span> <span class="c16">hiɛ</span><span class="c15">,
<a href="/contributions/33">Guinea-Bissau Kriyol</a></span> <span class="c16">obi</span><span class="c15">, <a href="/contributions/48">Palenquero</a></span> <span class="c16">kuchá</span> <span class="c15">or <a href="/contributions/59">Sango</a></span> <span class="c16">ma</span><span class="c15">. Some contact languages have a
general verb of sense perception, like <a href="/contributions/17">Nigerian Pidgin</a>, where
“</span><span class="c16">hyar</span> <span class="c15">‘hear’ can
be used to refer to stimuli detected by any of the senses”
(Faraclas 2013).</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c13">The present feature explores the extent of overlap in the
area of sense perception by focussing on the words meaning ‘to
hear’ and ‘to smell’.</span></p><h3 class="western c11" id="section-2thevalues">2. The

<a class="headerlink" href="#section-2thevalues" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="western c17">This feature
has four values:</p><p>value-table</p><p class="western c12"><span class="c28">Value 1</span><span class="c15">. We speak of</span>
<span class="c29">differentiation</span> <span class="c15">if one
word denotes ‘to hear’ and another word denotes ‘to smell’. Note
that this value also covers cases of (accidental) phonological
overlap, as illustrated by <a href="/contributions/70">Pidgin Hindustani</a></span> <span class="c16">suno</span> <span class="c15">‘to hear’ vs.</span>
<span class="c16">suŋo</span> <span class="c15">‘to smell’, because
they constitute separate words even though they are partially
identical.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">Differentiation of ‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’ is by far the
most common value in</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span><span class="c15">: 85% of the contact languages
in our sample use different words to encode ‘to hear’ and ‘to
smell’, as illustrated by Norf’k:</span></p><blockquote class="example" style="font-size:100%;padding-left:1.8em;margin-left:0.3em"><p class="western c12" style="text-indent:-2em"><span class="c15">(1)</span> <span class="c16">ya</span> <span class="c15">‘to

<span class="c29">identity</span> <span class="c15">if a single
word is used to express ‘to hear’ or ‘to smell’ and no word exists
that denotes only ‘to hear’ or only ‘to smell’.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">This is the case in <a href="/contributions/61">Fanakalo</a>, where</span> <span class="c16">izwa</span> <span class="c15">means both ‘to hear’ and ‘to
smell’ and where there is no other word whose meaning is restricted
to either ‘to hear’ or ‘to smell’. A number of</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">contributors point out that
the verb used has an even more general meaning, covering more sense
perceptions than just ‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’. In <a href="/contributions/58">Kikongo-Kituba</a>,
for example, “the basic meaning of</span> <span class="c16">wa</span> <span class="c15">is ‘perceive’” (Mufwene
2013).</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c13">Because of the semantic indeterminacy of the verb, the
context plays a crucial disambiguating role. The particular
interpretations of ‘to hear’ or ‘to smell’ arise in the context
and/or are created only in conjunction with the other constituents
that the general verb of sense perception combines with. Most often
this is the object expressing the perceived entity, as
in</span></p><blockquote class="example" id="ex-58-141" style="font-size:100%;padding-left:1.8em;margin-left:0.3em"><p class="western c14" style="text-indent:-2em"><span class="c13">(2) <a href="/contributions/58">Kikongo-Kituba</a> (Mufwene 2013)</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c30">Mono mene wa makelele.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">1</span><span class="c31">sg prf</span> <span class="c15">perceive noise</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c13">‘I have heard noise.’</span></p><small><a href="/sentences/58-141">See example 58-141</a></small></blockquote><p class="western c14"><span class="c30">Mono mene wa nsudi.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">1</span><span class="c31">sg prf</span> <span class="c15">perceive smell</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c13">‘I have smelt (sth.).’</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">In one</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span> <span class="c15">language, however, the disambiguation is achieved not by the
object of perception but by a prepositional phrase referring to the
organ of sense perception:</span></p><blockquote class="example" style="font-size:100%;padding-left:1.8em;margin-left:0.3em"><p class="western c14" style="text-indent:-2em"><span class="c13">(3) <a href="/contributions/74">Chinuk Wawa</a> (Grant 2013)</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c30">kámtaks kápa q’walên</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">know</span> <span class="c31">prep</span> <span class="c15">ear</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c13">‘to hear’</span></p></blockquote><p class="western c14"><span class="c30">kámtaks kápa nus</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">know</span> <span class="c31">prep</span> <span class="c15">nose</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c13">‘to smell’</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">It could be argued that the constructions illustrated by (2)
and (3) actually present cases of differentiation rather than
identity since in addition to the (identical) verb other
(different) sentence constituents are necessary to generate the
semantic concepts of ‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’. Following this
argumentation, the particularized meaning ‘to hear’ in
<a href="/contributions/58">Kikongo-Kituba</a> is represented by</span> <span class="c16">wa
makele</span> <span class="c15">and ‘to smell’ by</span>
<span class="c16">wa nsudi</span><span class="c15">. Seen this way,
while there is formal overlap between the constructions expressing
the two sense perceptions (</span><span class="c16">wa</span><span class="c15">), we are dealing with essentially
different forms because the two constructions are not identical
(</span><span class="c16">makele</span> <span class="c15">vs.</span> <span class="c16">nsudi</span><span class="c15">).
However, this line of argumentation presupposes that the
constituents form part of the verb, which they do not, or
that</span> <span class="c16">wa makele</span> <span class="c15">and</span> <span class="c16">wa nsudi</span> <span class="c15">are fixed expressions, for which there is no evidence. Also,
perception verbs are explicitly or implicitly transitive and thus
usually require an object, no matter whether or not a language has
an abstract perception verb (‘to perceive’) or particularized
perception verbs (‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’). Since this object is
necessarily different for hearing and smelling, both in languages
assigned to value 1 (differentiation) and to value 2 (identity),
they cannot form the basis of classification. This leaves us with
the verbs only, which seems to correspond to the intuition of the
speakers of “identity” language: At least for <a href="/contributions/58">Kikongo-Kituba</a> the
contributor’s “native speaker intuition is that the</span>
<span class="c31">same</span> <span class="c15">form is being used
in all these constructions,</span> <span class="c16">pace</span>
<span class="c15">the English translation” (Mufwene,
p.c.).</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">Identity between ‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’ is reported for
earlier stages of some</span> <span class="c16">APiCS</span>
<span class="c15">languages. For example, <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a></span>
<span class="c16">harem</span> <span class="c15">and the related
<a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a></span> <span class="c16">harim</span> <span class="c15">covered both meanings in earlier times (Meyerhoff 2013; Smith
&amp; Siegel 2013). It seems that this identity was broken up
through pressure from the lexifier English, whose</span>
<span class="c16">smell</span> <span class="c15">was borrowed to
cover the olfactory perception. As a consequence, the meaning
of</span> <span class="c16">harem</span><span class="c15">/</span><span class="c16">harim</span> <span class="c15">was
narrowed to auditory perception, just as in English.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c28">Value 3</span><span class="c15">.</span> <span class="c29">Overlap</span> <span class="c15">refers to cases where there
are two different (possibly related) words, but one of them denotes
‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’, and the other one denotes only ‘to hear’
or only ‘to smell’.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15">There are only three languages in the sample where this is
the case, all belonging to the West African <a href="/contributions/15">Krio</a></span><span class="c13">–</span><span class="c15">Pidgin English continuum. In <a href="/contributions/15">Krio</a>,
<a href="/contributions/16">Ghanaian Pidgin English</a> and <a href="/contributions/17">Nigerian Pidgin</a> the word derived from
English</span> <span class="c16">hear</span> <span class="c15">means ‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’, while the word derived
from</span> <span class="c16">smell</span> <span class="c15">means
‘to smell’ only. This overlap is probably an intermediary stage
between identity and differentiation, in which an older word
covering both hearing and smelling (identity) coexists with the
newly borrowed English</span> <span class="c16">smell</span>
<span class="c15">(incipient differentiation). For full
differentiation to develop, the more general older word will have
to undergo semantic narrowing to refer to auditory perception
only.</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c28">Value 4</span><span class="c15">. The</span> <span class="c29">identity and differentiation</span> <span class="c15">constellation is a combination of values 1 and 2: There are
at least three (possibly related) words; one denotes only ‘to hear’
and another denotes only ‘to smell’ (differentiation), and the
third denotes ‘to hear’ or ‘to smell’ (identity).</span></p><p class="western c12"><span class="c15"><a href="/contributions/34">Casamancese Creole</a> (Biagui &amp; Quint 2013) is the only

<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3distribution" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="western c12"><span class="c13">Values 2 (identity), 3 (overlap) and 4 (identity and
differentiation) all involve identity, that is, a word that covers
both auditory and olfactory perception. In this respect, these
values contrast with value 1 (differentiation), where there is no
word that both means ‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’. The map shows that
with one exception (<a href="/contributions/74">Chinuk Wawa</a>) all value 2, 3 and 4 languages are
located in Africa or on the Gulf of Guinea islands. Since these
languages have diverse lexifiers – African (<a href="/contributions/61">Fanakalo</a>,
<a href="/contributions/58">Kikongo-Kituba</a>, <a href="/contributions/60">Lingala</a>, <a href="/contributions/59">Sango</a>), English (<a href="/contributions/16">Ghanaian Pidgin English</a>,

<span class="c30">hear</span><span class="c13">–</span><span class="c30">smell</span> <span class="c13">identity, this suggests that
it must be due to African substrate and/or adstrate influence.
Indeed, <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="viberg1984">Viberg (1984</a>: 141–142) and <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="welmers1973">Welmers (1973</a>: 476) report a
wide distribution of ‘hear’– ‘smell’ identity in sub-Saharan
languages. However, the absence of identity in the African diaspora
creoles on the other side of the Atlantic remains a puzzle. More
research is clearly needed, including a comprehensive world-wide
typological study on perception verbs and an analysis of perception
verbs in earlier stages of contact languages.</span></p>
