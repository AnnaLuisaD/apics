    <body><p class="c10">The schwa vowel,
generally written as [ə], occurs frequently in unstressed syllables
in English, Dutch and French, as well as in European Portuguese
(though not in Spanish). This sound is interesting in the present
context because its distribution in the pidgins and creoles is much
more limited. It occurs in less than half of the <i>APiCS</i>
languages:</p><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" width="367">

</tbody></table><p class="c10">Schwa occurs in the
three Dutch-based languages, as well as in ten English-based
languages, which tend to be less basilectal, and in the Cape
Verdean Creole varieties, which are less basilectal than the other
Portuguese-based varieties of Africa. The more basilectal
English-based Atlantic creoles (such as <a href="/contributions/19">Pichi</a>, <a href="/contributions/16">Ghanaian Pidgin English</a>, <a href="/contributions/2">Sranan</a> and <a href="/contributions/3">Saramaccan</a>) lack schwa. In the French-based
languages, schwa is generally absent (with the exception of a few
words from French in <a href="/contributions/55">Mauritian Creole</a>).</p><p class="c10">Schwa from the
lexifier was widely replaced by other vowels, especially [i] and
[a]. For example, French [ə] becomes [i] in <a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a> (e.g.
<i>fimel</i> ‘female’, from French <i>femelle</i>) and <a href="/contributions/49">Haitian Creole</a> (<i>vini</i> ‘come’, from French <i>venir</i>) and [e] in
<a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a> (e.g. <i>letan</i> ‘time’, from French <i>le
temps</i> ‘the time’), and the second vowel of <i>fashion</i> is
transcribed as [ɑ] in <a href="/contributions/20">Chinese Pidgin English</a>.</p><p class="c10">While African
languages tend to have rich vowel systems <span>(cf. Chapter 121), they typically have symmetrical
five-vowel or seven-vowel systems lacking schwa (Holm 1988: 116),
so the relative scarcity of schwa in Atlantic pidgins and creoles
may be due to the influence of the indigenous African
languages.</span></p><p class="c10"><span>In the European languages, schwa is generally
restricted to unstressed syllables. The situation is similar in
many Malay varieties (e.g. <a href="/contributions/67">Singapore Bazaar Malay</a></span>
<span class="c22">belúm</span>
<span>‘not yet’), as well as in
Malay-influenced languages such as <a href="/contributions/42">Papiá Kristang</a> (e.g.</span>
<span class="c22">rëdónu</span>
<span>‘round’) and <a href="/contributions/43">Batavia Creole</a></span> <span class="c22">ótër</span> <span>‘other’
(from Portuguese</span> <span class="c22">outro;</span> <span>schwa is
written as</span> <span class="c22">ë</span><span>). But in South
Asian languages,</span> [ə] may also occur as the main vowel of a
monosyllabic word, e.g. <a href="/contributions/41">Sri Lanka Portuguese</a> <i>capa</i> ‘hat’
(schwa may be written as <i>a</i> in these languages).</p>
