subjects (agents of transitive verbs or single arguments of
single-argument verbs) are expressed when they either refer to the
speaker or hearer (‘I’, ‘you’, ‘we’, etc.) or to a third person
referent that is activated in the hearer’s mind and hence need not
be expressed by a full noun phrase. Overt forms used in such
circumstances are called</span> <span class="c11">person forms</span> <span class="c10">(<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="siewierska2004">Siewierska 2004</a>) or (more traditionally)</span>
<span class="c11">personal
pronouns</span><span class="c10">.
All languages have person forms, but not all languages necessarily
use them in subject position, because their content can often be
inferred from the context. When reference to the speaker or hearer
or to a third person referent is intended and no overt form is
used, we speak of</span> <span class="c11">zero anaphora</span><span class="c10">.</span></p><p class="western c9"><span class="c10">Typical examples of</span>

<span class="c10">(value 3, ex. 2).
Within the languages with obligatory person forms, we can make a
subdivision into languages with</span> <span class="c12">person forms that are words</span>
<span class="c10">(value 1, ex. 1)
and languages with</span> <span class="c12">person forms that are affixes</span> <span class="c10">(value 2, ex. 3 below). In addition,
we distinguish two minor types (cf. §4 below). This feature,
including the definition of the values, is based on Dryer
(2005m).</span></p><p class="western c19"><span class="c13">1. Obligatory pronoun words

pronominal subjects 3</span></p><p class="western c16">The map shows a striking areal regularity:
In the Atlantic region, all languages have obligatory subject
pronouns, while in the Indian Ocean and in Asia, almost all
languages have optional subject pronouns. The Pacific region
(Australia and the Pacific islands) again tends to have obligatory
pronouns. This is thus one of the features that show the clearest
geographical patterning, and is thus most clearly due to substrate
influence.</p><p class="western c14"><span class="c13">The West African substrate
languages that have influenced the structure of Atlantic creoles
show a very strong tendency to have obligatory subject pronoun
words or affixes (Dryer 2005m, <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="creissels2005">Creissels 2005</a>). This explains that
even the Portuguese-based creoles in the Atlantic have obligatory
pronouns, although Portuguese (at least European Portuguese, in
contrast to English and French) does not have obligatory pronouns.
On the other hand, the languages of South and Southeast Asia tend
to show optional pronouns, which is reflected in the
Portuguese-based and Spanish-based creoles of the region as well as
<a href="/contributions/20">Chinese Pidgin English</a> and <a href="/contributions/65">Chinese Pidgin Russian</a>, and the
languages based on Malay. Why the French-based languages of the
Indian Ocean pattern with the Asian languages is less clear. In the
Pacific islands, the Austronesian languages tend to be like the
African languages in requiring obligatory subject pronouns, so
again the fact that <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a> and <a href="/contributions/57">Tayo</a> have obligatory pronouns may
be explainable by the substrate.</span></p><p class="western c9"><span class="c10">Affixal pronouns (value 2),
which are always obligatory, are found only in those</span>
<span class="c11">APiCS</span>
<span class="c10">languages that are
closely related to non-European languages with affixal pronouns,
especially the mixed languages <a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a>, <a href="/contributions/73">Media Lengua</a> and <a href="/contributions/62">Mixed Ma’a/Mbugu</a>, but also in the Bantu-based <a href="/contributions/60">Lingala</a>. An example is

called “agreement markers”, but we do not use this terminology, for
the reasons given in <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="haspelmath2013">Haspelmath 2013</a>a+.)</span></p><p class="western c16">It should be noted, however, that the
distinction between affixal pronouns and pronoun words of the sort
seen in (1a) and (1b) is difficult to draw. For example, French
weak subject pronouns are written separately, but they have all the
properties of prefixes (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="miller1992">Miller 1992</a>). <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="creissels2005">Creissels (2005</a>) notes that
the same is true of West African languages: Weak subject pronouns
are often written separately as in English or French, but really
behave like prefixes. In general, making a distinction between
affixes and clitics (dependent words that cannot occur on their
own) is difficult (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="haspelmath2011b">Haspelmath 2011b</a>). And most of the languages
with obligatory pronoun words in subject position (value 1) have
special dependent person forms for the subject (values 2 and 4 of
Chapter 17). Whether one describes these special dependent person
forms as clitics or affixes is typically a matter of descriptive
tradition, and not so much due to real differences.</p><p class="western c14"><span class="c13">Note also that our major
distinction, between obligatory and optional pronouns, is rather
different from another well-known distinction, between “pro-drop”
(or “null-subject”) and “non-pro-drop” languages. The latter
correspond roughly to our types 1 and 4, and the former can be seen
as corresponding to type 2 and 3 (cf. <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="meyerhoff2000">Meyerhoff 2000</a>), but we
prefer not to use this terminology and this way of grouping the
phenomena (see also <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="haspelmath2013">Haspelmath 2013</a>a+).</span></p><h3 class="western c8" id="section-3distinguishingbetweenoptionalandobligatoryuse"><span class="c7">3. Distinguishing between

<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3distinguishingbetweenoptionalandobligatoryuse" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="western c16">There are many intermediate cases between
the two extremes of languages where person forms are always used
and languages where they are never used in non-contrastive
contexts. Almost all languages allow the omission of subject person
forms in imperatives, and many allow their omission in coordinate
structures.</p><p class="western c9"><span class="c10">The criterion for optionality
(type 3) that we asked our contributors to adopt was whether or not
person forms are omitted strikingly more often than in English.
According to den Besten &amp; Biberauer (2013), this is not the
case in <a href="/contributions/29">Afrikaans</a>, for instance, even though this language allows
the omission of the first</span> <span class="c20">person singular pronoun in the spoken language
(</span><span class="c21">Verstaan
nie</span> <span class="c20">=</span>
<span class="c21">Ek verstaan
nie</span> <span class="c20">‘I don’t
understand’), but English is similar. For <a href="/contributions/28">Berbice Dutch</a>, Kouwenberg
(2013a) argues that</span> <span class="c22">pronominal arguments
cannot be considered optional, because they cannot be omitted in
out-of-the-blue sentences, as would be the case in a pro-drop
language, even though pronominal subjects are frequently omitted in
discourse. This is probably the most extreme case, where a
different decision would have been possible.</span></p><h3 class="western c16" id="section-4theminortypes"><span class="c7">4. The minor
