The state meaning (\u2018is tired\u2019, \u2018is ripe\u2019, \u2018is wet\u2019, etc.) arises in a perfect(ive) context, and perfective is of course often expressed by zero: As we saw in the preceding chapter, unmarked dynamic verbs often have past (perfective) reference. A clear example of this is the word w\u00f4 in Principense: Bana s\u00ea sa w\u00f4 [plantain the prog ripen] means \u2018The plaintain is ripening\u2019, and the state \u2018The plantain is ripe\u2019 is expressed by the zero-marked perfective aspect: Bana s\u00ea \u00d8 w\u00f4 [plantain the pfv ripen] \u2018The plantain (has) ripened (i.e. is ripe)\u2019 (Maurer 2013c). The word w\u00f4 cannot be used attributively by itself, but needs the participial suffix -du (bana w\u00f4du \u2018ripe banana\u2019).
