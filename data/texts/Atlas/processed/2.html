phrases containing (full) nouns, rather than those involving only a
pronominal word or a proper noun. This is because in some languages
pronominal and/or proper noun possessors occur in different
positions than nominal ones. Compare <a href="/contributions/70">Pidgin Hindustani</a>, where
pronominal possessors follow the possessum but nominal possessors
precede it (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="siegel2013">Siegel 2013</a>):</span></p><p class="western c10"><span class="c11">(1)</span> <span class="c12">Wau kii kela papale wau.</span>

affixes on the head or the possessor noun is irrelevant for this

person possessive determiner is placed between the possessor and
the possessum (cf. Chapter 38 “Marking of possessor noun phrases”),

Distribution
<a href="#top" style="vertical-align: bottom" title="go to top of the page">⇫</a>
<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3distribution" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="western c10"><span class="c31">Numerical</span><span class="c33">.</span> <span class="c13">Overall, possessor-final is the somewhat more common order in
the</span> <span class="c33">APiCS</span> <span class="c13">sample.
This tendency is a little stronger when one considers only those
languages that show just one order (“excl” in the value box above)
and also holds – albeit to a lesser extent – when the</span>
<span class="c33">APiCS</span> <span class="c13">values are reduced
to match</span> <span class="c33">WALS</span><span class="c13">:
predominantly possessor-initial 33, predominantly possessor-final
36, no dominant order 8. This is somewhat against the trend among
the world’s languages: predominantly possessor-initial 685,
predominantly possessor-final 467, no dominant order 96 (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="dryer2011">Dryer
2011</a>d) but it has to be kept in mind that the</span> <span class="c33">APiCS</span> <span class="c13">sample is not typologically
balanced.</span></p><p class="western c10"><span class="c31">By lexifier/substrate</span><span class="c13">. Most African
slaves in the Atlantic region originated from areas where
Niger-Congo languages were spoken. These languages show a rather
well-defined distribution regarding the order of possessor and
possessum (cf. <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="dryer2011">Dryer 2011</a>d): in the extreme west, the Atlantic
subfamily is mostly possessor-final. Further east, and stretching
to the western border of Nigeria, other Niger-Congo subfamilies are
possessor-initial, while Nigerian languages und the large Bantu
genus again show a possessor-final order. Substratal input in the
Atlantic contact languages thus often provided a mix of both
orders.</span></p><p class="western c16">While English
also has both orders, it is interesting that of the 19
English-lexicon contact languages in the Atlantic nine are
exclusively possessor-initial but none is exclusively
possessor-final. Also, in those languages that exhibit both orders,
possessor-final is never the dominant one, with the sole exception
of <a href="/contributions/1">Early <a href="/contributions/2">Sranan</a></a>.</p><p class="western c10"><span class="c13">On the other hand, in nine of the ten Portuguese-lexified
Atlantic creoles the possessor categorically follows the possessum.
The explanation is probably that both Portuguese and the dominant
substrates of the Gulf of Guinea and the Cape Verdean Creoles,
Bantu and Atlantic languages, are also of this type. <a href="/contributions/47">Papiamentu</a> is
the only Atlantic Ibero-Romance-lexified creole that has both
orders. Slaves from the Togo-Benin area (cf. Maurer 2013d) or
indeed the Dutch construction (e.g.</span> <span class="c33">Jan
zijn huis</span> <span class="c13">[Jan his house] ‘Jan’s house’)
may have contributed the minority possessor-initial
order.</span></p><p class="western c16">The French
creoles of the Caribbean and the Americas are exclusively
possessor-final, following the lexifier French, although there must
have been possessor-initial substratal input.</p><p class="western c16">The
Dutch-lexified languages <a href="/contributions/29">Afrikaans</a> and <a href="/contributions/27">Negerhollands</a> show both
orders, but <a href="/contributions/28">Berbice Dutch</a> is an exclusive possessor-initial
language, which may be due to the strong substratal influence of
Ijo, a southern Nigerian possessor-initial language (see <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="smith1999">Smith
1999</a>: 254ff).</p><p class="western c16">In all the
African- and Arabic-lexified contact varieties in central and
southern Africa the possessor can only follow the possessum, maybe
because this is the dominant order in the main lexifiers and
African substrates. On the other hand, <a href="/contributions/29">Afrikaans</a> allows both
orders, just like its lexifier Dutch.</p><p class="western c16">The picture is
different when we turn to the Indian Ocean and South Asia: except
for <a href="/contributions/54">Reunion Creole</a>, all French and Portuguese creoles allow the
possessor-initial order to varying degrees. In the South Asian
varieties <a href="/contributions/39">Diu Indo-Portuguese</a>, <a href="/contributions/40">Korlai</a> and <a href="/contributions/41">Sri Lanka Portuguese</a>, the
possessor-initial order can be explained by the fact that Indian
languages overwhelmingly prefer this order. This may also be the
reason why <a href="/contributions/66">Sri Lankan Malay</a> does not follow Standard Malay’s
possessor-final order (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="prentice1990">Prentice 1990</a>: 928). The island creoles of
Mauritius, Reunion and the Seychelles received an early and strong
substratal possessor-final input through slaves from Madagascar and
later from the Kenya region. This agreed with the lexifier order
and seems to have been the reason why there is a strong preference
in these varieties for possessor-final, even though the other order
was also imported to Mauritius and Reunion, from West Africa
(Mandinka) and India. Where possessor-initial also occurs
(<a href="/contributions/55">Mauritian Creole</a>, <a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a>) it is in the minority and a
more recent development, cf. <a href="/contributions/55">Mauritian Creole</a>, where it “is not
attested until about 1880” (Baker &amp; Kriegel 2013a).</p><p class="western c10"><span class="c13">In the Pacific, <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a> and the closely related <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a> are
strictly possessor-final. For <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a> this could be seen as
surprising, since mainland New Guinea is predominantly
possessor-initial (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="dryer2011">Dryer 2011</a>d; and <a href="/contributions/69">Yimas-Arafundi Pidgin</a> also has
this order) and <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a>’s lexifier English has both orders. As
with Features 1 “Order of subject, object, and verb” and 3 “Order
of adjective and noun”, the answer is probably found in <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a>’s
strong substratal input from the Bismarck Archipelago, where the
majority of languages, including the important substrate Tolai,
have a dominant possessor-final order (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="dryer2011">Dryer 2011</a>d). The languages
of Vanuatu are also overwhelmingly possessor-final and <a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a>
unsurprisingly follows this. Note also that <a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a>’s and
<a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a>’s possessive constructions of the</span> <span class="c33">house belong father</span> <span class="c13">type may have
been consolidated by the phrasal correspondence in English
(</span><span class="c33">the house belongs to father</span>
<span class="c13">or</span> <span class="c33">the house that
belongs to father</span><span class="c13">). The possessor-initial
order of <a href="/contributions/20">Chinese Pidgin English</a> is easier to explain, Cantonese
preferring that order. <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a> and <a href="/contributions/72">Gurindji <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a></a> in Australia allow
both orders, maybe because the Aboriginal languages in the Northern
Territories are also rather heterogeneous in this respect. In
<a href="/contributions/26">Hawai‘i Creole</a>, there is a strong preference for possessor-initial,
in spite of the fact that the substrates provided a mix of orders:
Chinese and Japanese = possessor-initial, Hawaiian and Portuguese =
possessor-final. The possessor can both precede and follow the
possessum in Norf’k, probably because both English and the
contributing language Tahitian (cf. Mühlhäusler 2013a) allow both
orders.</span></p>
