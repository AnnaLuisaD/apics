French, for instance, uses dans in both contexts: Je suis dans la cuisine 'I am in the kitchen', Je la pousse dans la cuisine 'I push her into the kitchen.' In some varieties of English, too, causative motion verbs like put and push may show the preposition in, as in She put her gloves in the pocket, where the more standard variety would have the motion-to preposition into (She put her gloves into the pocket). Portuguese and Spanish do not seem to have these constructions. Therefore, this marking pattern in French- and English-based creoles may well be inherited from the European lexifier languages. But there are numerous Portuguese- and Spanish-based creoles which also show at-rest marking to express motion-to, e.g. Diu Indo-Portuguese in (4). Here, a different explanation must be sought. Maybe the relevant substrates show the same pattern.",
