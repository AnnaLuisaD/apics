<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1alignmentinmonotransitiveconstructions" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="western c14"><span class="c11">Like the preceding chapter, this chapter looks at the three
main alignment patterns in monotransitive constructions: neutral
alignment (with transitive agent A, transitive patient P, and
intransitive sole argument S all treated in the same way),
accusative alignment (A treated like S, P treated in a special
way), and ergative alignment (P treated like S, A treated in a
special way). The difference is that here we look at the way in
which</span> <span class="c12">personal pronouns</span>
<span class="c11">(‘I’, ‘you’, ‘she’, ‘we’, etc.) are treated, and
we will see that they pattern rather differently from full noun
phrases. As elsewhere in the world’s languages (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="silverstein1976">Silverstein 1976</a>,
<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="dixon1994">Dixon 1994</a>: 83-94), we find that in the</span> <span class="c13">APiCS</span> <span class="c11">languages, too, personal
pronouns show significantly more accusative patterning than full
NPs, as well as less ergative marking.</span></p><p class="western c14"><span class="c11">In fact, there is no ergative alignment with personal
pronouns attested in our languages at all: The only language with
an ergative pattern of full NPs, <a href="/contributions/72">Gurindji <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a></a>, shows accusative
alignment with personal pronouns, for example the contrast</span>
<span class="c13">dei</span> <span class="c11">(‘they’, A and S)
vs.</span> <span class="c13">dem/jem</span> <span class="c11">(‘them’, P):</span></p><p class="western c15">(1)<a href="/contributions/72">Gurindji <a href="/contributions/25">Kriol</a></a> (Meakins 2013)</p><p class="western c14"><span class="c11">a.</span> <span class="c16">Dei</span> <span class="c17">bin luk det ngakparn gat nyanuny femli.</span></p><p class="western c15">3PL.SBJ PST see DET frog with 3SG.DAT

between independent and dependent person forms (see Chapter 17), we
consider only the dependent person forms here, because these are
much more commonly used as subjects and objects.</p><h3 class="western c15" id="section-2thefeaturevalues"><span class="c9">2. The feature values</span>
<a href="#top" style="vertical-align: bottom" title="go to top of the page">⇫</a>
<a class="headerlink" href="#section-2thefeaturevalues" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c15">The two feature values
are thus only (i) neutral alignment (i.e. no subject-object
distinction in personal pronouns) and (ii) accusative alignment
(i.e. a subject-object distinction). It turns out that more than
half of the <i>APiCS</i> languages have accusative alignment, i.e.
a subject-object distinction in person forms.</p><p>value-table</p><p class="c15">Interestingly, this
effect is much stronger in the <i>APiCS</i> languages than in the
world’s languages in general. In <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="comrie2005">Comrie (2005</a>), neutral alignment
in full NPs is about twice as common as accusative alignment in
full NPs, but with personal pronouns, this relationship is not
reversed: Neutral alignment still prevails over accusative
alignment, though by a much smaller margin. However, this
difference may to some extent be due to the fact that Comrie
considered only independent personal pronouns; as <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="siewierska2005">Siewierska
(2005</a>b) shows, when only bound person forms are considered,
accusative alignment is more than twice as common as neutral
alignment in the world’s languages, so the preference for
accusativity is even stronger.</p><p class="c15">There is a general
implicational relationship between accusative alignment in full NPs
and personal pronouns: If a language has a subject-object
distinction in full NPs, it also has such a distinction in person
forms (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="silverstein1976">Silverstein 1976</a>). Thus, the 54 accusative languages in this
chapter include all 14 accusative languages of the preceding
chapter.</p><h3 class="c15" id="section-3partialdistinctions"><span class="c9">3.

<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3partialdistinctions" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c15">In most languages, not

quite typical, also in that they do not show a consistent pattern,
i.e. no specific accusative marker can be discerned. Case-marking
is thus suppletive, and for this reason, these forms are not
normally treated as different (nominative vs. accusative) cases,
but as different subject and object forms. (From our perspective,
however, there is no difference between these two ways of talking
about the contrasts.)</p><p class="c15">In some languages, the
distinction is even more partial than in the three languages above.
For example, in Atlantic English-based languages, typically only
the first person singular and/or the third person singular makes a
distinction:</p><blockquote class="example" style="font-size:100%;padding-left:1.8em;margin-left:0.3em"><p class="c15" style="text-indent:-2em">(5) <span class="c31">1sg 3sg</span></p><p class="c15"><a href="/contributions/5">Creolese</a>

very partial paradigms have been counted as exhibiting accusative
alignment. A limiting case is <a href="/contributions/47">Papiamentu</a>, where there is only a
single distinction in some varieties of the language (2nd person
singular accusative <i>bu</i>, contrasting with the neutral form
<i>bo</i>, only in the Curaçao variety), so this language has been
considered to show neutral alignment.</p><h3 class="c27" id="section-4orginsofaccusativemarkingonpersonalpronouns"><span class="c9">4.

<a class="headerlink" href="#section-4orginsofaccusativemarkingonpersonalpronouns" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c15">The <i>APiCS</i>
languages can be grouped into three diachronic types with respect
to the origin of their accusative marking.</p><p class="c15">In the first type, the
accusative forms derive from special accusative prepositions or
postpositions/case suffixes. This is the case with those languages
that have patient markers in full NPs, too, especially Portuguese-
and Spanish-based creoles in South and Southeast Asia:</p><p class="c32">(6)<a href="/contributions/40">Korlai</a> <i>pe-l</i>

<i>kun-éle</i> ‘him’</p><p class="c15">(Steinkrüger 2013)
(<i>kun-</i> &lt; Spanish <i>con</i>)</p><p class="c15">A French-based
language in which the person forms have preposition-derived
accusative forms is <a href="/contributions/54">Reunion Creole</a> (<i>a-mwen</i> ‘me’, <i>a-li</i>
‘him’, <i>a-nou</i> ‘us’, etc., from French <i>à</i>).</p><p class="c15">In the second type,
the special nominative and accusative forms were inherited from the
lexifier. This is the case with many English-based languages, such
as <a href="/contributions/16">Ghanaian Pidgin English</a> in (3) above, as well as the languages
shown in (5). The English lexifier is different from the Romance
lexifiers in that it has no clitic personal pronouns, so the case
distinctions of the independent pronouns sometimes survived. In the
Romance-based languages, the clitic personal pronouns were
invariably lost, so no case distinctions generally survived from
the lexifiers. (An exception is the distinction between <i>i</i>
and <i>li</i> in <a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a>, which seems to go back to the
French <i>il/lui</i> contrast.) It should be noted, however, that
in some of the more basilectal Caribbean English-based varieties,
no case distinctions are made, and it is only due to contact with
English that the distinctions are reemerging.</p><p class="c15">Accusative pronoun
forms were also inherited from a source language in some of the
mixed languages such as <a href="/contributions/73">Media Lengua</a>, <a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a> and <a href="/contributions/62">Mixed Ma’a/Mbugu</a>.</p><p class="c15">In the third type, the
nominative–accusative contrast has come about by sound changes,
which often affect subject pronouns more than object pronouns, so
that they tend to be shorter. This can be seen in some of the forms
in (4) from <a href="/contributions/33">Guinea-Bissau Kriyol</a>, and also in the forms in (7).</p><blockquote class="example" style="font-size:100%;padding-left:1.8em;margin-left:0.3em"><p class="c15" style="text-indent:-2em">(7) subject object</p><p class="c15"><a href="/contributions/53">Louisiana Creole</a>

subject forms than in the object forms is also generally found in
<a href="/contributions/68">Ambon Malay</a> (see (2) above), but the opposite may also be found (in
the 3rd singular neutral form <i>akang</i> vs. <i>ang</i>).</p>
